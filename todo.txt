- add lint/test watching with chokidar-cli
- minify html?
- use static html in browser-sync?

- LATER:
  - issue:
    - dev index.html must have script tag, mut not have style tag
    - dist index.html injects script tag and style tag
    - any way to use one file for both?
  - make kirei-css loader instead of using postcss at all
    - has to work with imports
  - tree shake with rollup
